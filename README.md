## Running solutions

Unless otherwise stated solutions should be run from the root of the project
with `./run.sh <day>` e.g for day 1 and day 11
```bash
./run.sh 01
./run.sh 11
```

Additional run options may be passed after the number, e.g. to run with the
`ReleaseFast` optimisation
```bash
./run.sh 11 -O ReleaseFast
```
